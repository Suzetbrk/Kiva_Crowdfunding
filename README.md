# Kiva_Crowdfunding


While the access to finance has improved over the years, more than 1.7 billion people around the world are still unbanked and can’t access basic financial services like borrowing. An increasing number of people have been resorting to crowdfunding loans to start businesses, invest in equipment or even pay tuition fees.

For this project we will be using crowdfunding data from Kiva, a San Francisco based non profit organization. Kiva’s dataset contains data from about 2 millions loans.

Approach
We plan to build 2 models:
Consider a linear regression to model the time it takes to secure funding
Logistic regression to model whether a loan request was denied or accepted

Concerns:
We want to use a sample of the dataset to do preliminary analysis and modeling, but since we have a very large dataset, how can we make sure that we are using a sample that is representative of of all the data

Research Questions
What are the crowdfunding loans going towards?
What does the distribution of the loan amount look like?
How many people tend to contribute to each loan?
Is there a relationship between the different variables in the loan profile and the number of days it takes to fund the loan?
What factors led to the denial of the loan?
Additional research questions will be discussed after the exploratory data analysis.
